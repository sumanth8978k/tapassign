    <p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design, according to Wikipedia. It's free, open-source, and focuses on building web applications by handling common tasks like user authentication, database connections, and form handling, allowing developers to focus on building their unique features. 
Key Features and Benefits:
Rapid Development:
Django simplifies web development by providing pre-built components and tools, reducing the need to reinvent the wheel. 
DRY Principle:
Django emphasizes reusability of components ("Don't Repeat Yourself"), leading to cleaner and more maintainable code. </p>
